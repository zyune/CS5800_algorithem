Linear Programming
# Technique definition (no problem/solution required)

Linear programming is one of the important branches of operations research. (Operational research is a discipline that solves optimal solutions under certain constraints. It applies existing scientific and technological knowledge and mathematical means to solve various problems in real life. It is an applied discipline.) There are also branches of operations research, planning theory, queuing theory, graph theory, decision theory and so on.
