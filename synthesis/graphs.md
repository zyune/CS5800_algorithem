## 4.4 connectivity and strongly connected regions

###connectivity in undirected graph:

> a graph that is not connected can be decomposed in a natural and obvious manner into several connected components
> in directed graph Two nodes u and v of a directed graph are connected if there is a path from u to v and a path from v to u.
